# Credit Card Customers
A manager at a bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is going to get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction.

This dataset consists of 10,000 customers mentioning their age, salary, marital status, credit card limit, credit card category, etc. There are 20 features.

In this project, we will analyze the dataset and try to see if we can gleam any patterns or characteritics of churning customers. Then, we are going to build a simple machine learning model to predict whether a customer will leave the credit card service or not.
